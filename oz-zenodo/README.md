# Zenodo

## BLR images

BLR has images extracted from papers, linked to the original paper. Here we use a local CouchDB version of BLR to get just the images linked to an external DOI (I.e., for the paper), retrieve Zenodo JSON-LD, and enhance by adding links to thumbnails and images (which doesnâ€™t Zenodo do this?)

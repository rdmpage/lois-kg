Our studies have shown that it is associated with Malaysian primary lowland dipterocarp forests, ecosystems which are vanishing rapidly due to extensive human activity. This is the first record of 
                    <italic>H. tawonoides</italic> in Malaysia. Behavioral aspects, such as mud-puddling among bees and acoustic mimicry, are discussed and shown in a video. A morphological redescription, including features visible on live individuals only, is provided. The DNA barcode sequence is given, with comparison to closely related species.

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>The rainforests of Southeast Asia are one of the most biodiverse areas on earth. Because of climate change and a high deforestation rate, among others, they are also one of the most vulnerable. Over the last 2 million years, during glacial periods, sea levels in Sundaland were lower than at present. Sumatra, Java, and Borneo were linked to Peninsular Malaysia and the Asian mainland by the Sunda Shelf, enabling species migration, especially along rivers (

                <italic>Heterosphecia</italic> (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1940082917739774">Le Cerf, 1916</xref>), which includes eight species, occurs from South India to Sumatra and Borneo; however, it is known only from several records. Thus, their conservation status is currently unknown. 
                <italic>Heterosphecia tawonoides</italic> was described in 2003 by Kallies based on a unique specimen collected in Sumatra (Indonesia) in 1887 (exact location unknown) and kept in the Natural History Museum in Vienna. Thus, it is a “lost species,” such as those defined by Global Wildlife Conservation, an organization which along with more than 100 IUCN Species Survival Commission’s Specialist Groups established a project entitled “The Search for Lost Species” (
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://lostspecies.org/">https://lostspecies.org/</ext-link>) aiming to rediscover and protect species which have not been seen for many years.

                <italic>H. tawonoides</italic> were collected and analyzed morphologically and genetically. Genitalia morphology confirmed that the collected specimens are indeed 
                <italic>H. tawonoides</italic>. All of the observed individuals were seen mud-puddling on a sandy/pebble river bank, a behavior recorded only recently for the family Sesiidae (

            <p>The original description of 
                <italic>H. tawonoides</italic> was made based on a single, old specimen, which is missing important morphological features. The genus 
                <italic>Heterosphecia</italic> is characterized by tufts of hair-like scales on the hind legs. The holotype lacks the hind legs and currently also the abdomen (utilized for dissection by 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1940082917739774">Kallies, 2003</xref>), and its body coloration has faded. Moreover, the natural habitat and behavior of this species remained unknown. Recent observations of 
                <italic>H. tawonoides</italic> in its natural habitat, described herein, have allowed to notice not only behavioral aspects, but also important morphological details, including those visible only on live individuals.

Male genitalia were dissected and prepared as follows: (1) maceration of the abdomen in boiling 10% KOH, (2) dissection in 10% ethanol, (3) dehydration in 30%, 60%, and 100% ethanol, respectively, and (4) mounting in Euparal. Morphological details were studied with a Leica M80 stereomicroscope and photographed using a Leica M205A. Morphology of male genitalia was compared with Figure 7 in the study of

                <title>Behavior</title>
                <p>
                    <italic>H. tawonoides</italic> was observed mud-puddling on a river bank in a lowland dipterocarp rainforest. This behavior is generally associated with male Lepidoptera (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1940082917739774">Beck, Muhlenberg, &amp; Fiedler, 1999</xref>). The four collected specimens were indeed males, and thus it is highly probable that so were the remaining observed individuals. 
                    <italic>H. tawonoides</italic> flies in full sunlight or half-shade between 10:30 and 16:30, in a temperature 29–35℃ and humidity 51%–88%. One individual was observed in July 2013, nine from the end of April to mid-May in 2016, and two in March 2017. 
                    <italic>H. tawonoides</italic> flies individually; only once two individuals were seen in the same area but far from each other. The flight is rapid, although the sesiid is easily spotted in sunlight because of its shiny blue coloration. When puddling, 
                    <italic>H. tawonoides</italic> walks around and flies from one rock to another, evidently searching for the best spot with its proboscis, by licking the rock/moist sand. It often puddled among many different species of bees, including the much bigger 
                    <italic>Apis dorsata</italic> Fabricius (Supplementary video TC: 01:20–01:49). It is worth noting that 
                    <italic>H. tawonoides</italic> was the only Lepidopteran which mud-puddled among bees; other butterflies gathered in a distance from the hymenopterans. Even when startled, the clearwing moth often returned to the same spot in a few seconds, perhaps because it had found a good source of nutrients. It was also seen puddling on a dead leaf washed out by the river, on human skin, and once on a patch of sand smelling of rotten fish, which could mean it is searching not only for salt but also for proteins, a habit previously recorded for Nymphalidae, Hesperiidae, and Lycaenidae (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1940082917739774">Beck et al., 1999</xref>).
                </p>
                <p>When startled, 
                    <italic>H. tawonoides</italic> pushes itself away with its legs rapidly and unfolds its wings while already in the air (Supplementary video TC: 02:16–02:29). However, when taking off calmly, it will unfold its wings when still on the ground and push itself away from the ground (Supplementary video TC: 02:30–02:57). In flight, it keeps its legs folded against its abdomen. Moreover, 
                    <italic>H. tawonoides</italic> makes a buzzing sound which has been recorded (Supplementary video TC: 03:00–03:13). This might be a case of acoustic mimicry of bees.

                <italic>H. tawonoides</italic> observed in the wild shows evident resemblance to bees. The bee and wasp mimicry of Sesiidae is widely known (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1940082917739774">Duckworth &amp; Eichlin, 1974</xref>). A species of 
                <italic>Heterosphecia</italic> very similar to 
                <italic>H. tawonoides</italic>, 
                <italic>H. robinsoni</italic> (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1940082917739774">Kallies, 2003</xref>) was collected in Sabah, Borneo, in 1973 by K. M. Guichard, who suggested it is a 
                <italic>Crocisa</italic> (= 
                <italic>Thyreus</italic> Panzer) bee mimic. The close similarity of the two 
                <italic>Heterosphecia</italic> species supports the idea that this might also be the case in 
                <italic>H. tawonoides</italic>. It has been proven that mimics do not have to be perfect imitations of another species to gain protection (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1940082917739774">Dittrich, Gilbert, Green, McGregor, &amp; Grewcock, 1993</xref>), mimicry is often not a one-to-one species relationship (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1940082917739774">Edmunds, 1999</xref>). Imitating widespread features, for example, bright bands on the abdomen, is common in Sesiidae and might be more profitable than being a specialized mimic. In the field, the most eye-catching characteristic of 
                <italic>H. tawonoides</italic> is its strikingly blue, shiny coloration (Supplementary video TC: 00:21–00:23; 00:59–01:11; 01:44–01:48, 02:35–02:44; 
                <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1940082917739774">Figure 3</xref>) similar to that of many species of the genus 
                <italic>Thyreus</italic> occurring in Malaysia (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1940082917739774">Lieftinck, 1962</xref>), as well as other bees including 
                <italic>Amegilla cingulata</italic> Fabricius or 
                <italic>Xylocopa caerulea</italic> Fabricius. It is worth noting that 
                <italic>A. cingulata</italic> was seen puddling at the exact same location as 
                <italic>H. tawonoides</italic> and that both of these insects have blue, light-reflecting bands on the abdomen. Thus, 
                <italic>H. tawonoides</italic> is most probably not a mimic of a single model species, but imitates features found in many bees which are widespread in Southeast Asia (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1940082917739774">Lieftinck, 1962</xref>). Behavioral and acoustic mimicry, as well as the biology of this elusive clearwing moth, would be interesting topics for future studies on this species. Finding the food plant would allow to answer the question how strictly 
                <italic>H. tawonoides</italic> is associated with its habitat. Can the larvae be found on plants which occur only in Southeast Asian primary rainforests?

            <title>Implications for Conservation</title>
            <p>Knowledge on the habitat, behavior, and conservation status of Oriental Sesiidae is scarce and photographic documentation exceeding that of pinned specimens in museum collections is extremely uncommon. New species descriptions are often made based only on 100-year-old specimens and are limited to morphological features. Even DNA barcoding is rarely done in such cases. It is also not uncommon that an old holotype is the only known record for a taxon providing no information whatsoever if the species still exists (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1940082917739774">Hochkirch, 2016</xref>). This was also the case for 
                <italic>H. tawonoides</italic> until its rediscovery described herein. This species, as well as other sesiids studied by the authors (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1940082917739774">Skowron Volponi &amp; Volponi, 2017</xref>; 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1940082917739774">Skowron et al., 2015</xref>), seems to be associated with a very specific habitat: banks of clean rivers flowing through Malaysian primary lowland dipterocarp forests. These highly vulnerable ecosystems are vanishing rapidly. Malaysia has one of the most biodiverse ecosystems and the highest deforestation rates in the world. Forest loss reached 14.4% between 2000 and 2012. At the same time, Malaysia’s oil palm plantations grew by approximately 50% (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940082917739774">Butler, 2013</xref>).
            </p>
            <p>Because of their elusive nature, members of the Sesiidae family are rarely observed in their natural habitat, and thus it is impossible to estimate the size of specific populations. However, over several years of studies in the same area, observing habitats typical for sesiids, the authors observed only 12 individuals of 
                <italic>H. tawonoides</italic> (or maybe even less as they might have been the same moths returning to a chosen spot). This, as well as the fact that this species has not been seen for 130 years, indicates that it is not common. 
                <italic>H. tawonoides</italic> is only an example of a species associated with primary rainforests: other sesiids but also charismatic mammals such as tigers, elephants, gibbons, and sun bears, to name just a few, are additional animals which will vanish along with these ecosystems. Given the current rate of habitat loss and species extinction, it is of crucial importance to study and catalog both species new to science and those that have been discovered many years ago and not seen since that time. Without knowledge of biodiversity, its conservation is impossible.
